<p>A patent can help every company build market share and margins. Let's take one very popular example that is usually used to explain the benefits of obtaining patents. We all know that Apple's iPhone is far from being the most sold product on a global scale. In fact, it has a very small piece of the international smartphone market pie. However, we also know that it captures the great bulk of the marketâ€™s profit just because people behind the brand were really quick to patent everything they could.</p> 
  <p>they obviously had excellent lawyers that knew exactly how to develop a viable strategy and protect their client's inventions. Of course, Apple is not the only company that has made the most of patent legal advice, there are a myriad of such examples, from giants like Amazon to family enterprises you have never heard about. The point is when you have something that can be used by other people, you can make a heck of a lot of money and grow your market share far beyond your expectations, but only under one condition - if you get your invention patented.</p>
